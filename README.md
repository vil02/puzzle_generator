Basic functionality of [`puzzle_generator`](./puzzle_generator) is to generate
a single python file representing a puzzle or quiz.
The upcoming questions are stored in an encrypted form,
so it is _difficult_ to read them before providing correct answers.
The generated file does not have any external dependencies.
